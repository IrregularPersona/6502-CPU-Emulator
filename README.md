# Intro
> This has been an interest for me to do, since 2 years ago (but had to put it aside). 
This is not done as I've only made around 27 instruction implementations out of 137. Dave Poo's video
originally was the one that piqued my interest. Would probably make my own version as this has direct 
copies from his videos.
